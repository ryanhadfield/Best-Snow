# Best Snow

This app will use the [Powderlines API](http://powderlin.es/api.html) to retrieve snow data for requested SNOTEL stations. The [Bing Maps API](https://www.bing.com/api/maps/sdk/mapcontrol/isdk/Overview) then shows the SNOTEL stations on a map with snowflake icons representing each station.
## Description

When a user initiates the webpage, they can click on any snowflake on the map and the Powderlines free API for accessing SNOTEL station data will find current snow levels in the station selected. The color of the snowflake represents if the snow level is below average, average, or above average (the darker the snowflake, the higher the snow level). Once you click on a station the following information is provided below the map: the name of the station, elevation, and snow depth. This is also shown in two different graphs, the first shows seasonal snow depth and the second shows snow depth on that day from 2015-Present.
